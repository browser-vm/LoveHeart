## Links
COMING SOON!!!

## Releases
There will be no official release for version 0.0.2. However, we are working on an update to make links one-use - so that if you have a pesky parent or heavy usage restriction protocols they can't access the link by checking their internet logs.

## Issues
If you need another link, [email me](mailto:namelessonbandlab@outlook.com). We refuse to be blocked by censors.
